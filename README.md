So far the repository has two functions:

1. Simulation of a single player softmax MAB problem:
  This calculates and vizualizes the accumulated reward
  against the round number for a certain value of tau.
  In order to do this:
  - Access script: Single_Player_Softmax_MAB.py
  - Change MAB and Team values accordingly
  - Run script
  
2. Simulation of a team with members defined by verbosity solving a MAB problem: 
  This calculates and plots the accumulated reward, accumulated 
  regret and rate of choosing the best reward against the round 
  number for different values of tau.
  In order to do this:
  - Access script: Simulate.py
  - Change MAB and Team values accordingly
  - Run script
